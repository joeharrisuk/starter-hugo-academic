title: Benchmarking Information Scrambling
abstract: Information scrambling refers to the rapid spreading of initially
  localized information over an entire system, via the generation of global
  entanglement. This effect is usually detected by measuring a temporal decay of
  the out-of-time order correlators. However, in experiments, decays of these
  correlators suffer from fake positive signals from various sources, e.g.,
  decoherence due to inevitable couplings to the environment, or errors that
  cause mismatches between the purported forward and backward evolutions. In
  this Letter, we provide a simple and robust approach to single out the effect
  of genuine scrambling. This allows us to benchmark the scrambling process by
  quantifying the degree of the scrambling from the noisy backgrounds. We also
  demonstrate our protocol with simulations on IBM cloud-based quantum
  computers.
